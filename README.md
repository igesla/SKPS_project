# SKPS_project
OpenFoam simulation. Laminar flow around a cylinder, visualising structures on different Reynolds number.

This is an academic project made created based on Asmaa Hadane open tutorials https://github.com/AsmaaHADANE/Youtube-Tutorials/blob/master/flow_around_cylinder.zip

The project is altered to simulated flow at different Reynolds numbers, from unseparated flow at Re=3, through Re=30 where pair of vortices are fixed in the wake, 180 - the case presented in the Asmaa Hadane tutorial --> a laminar vortex street to Re=1000 where the boundary layer is laminar up to the separation point.
