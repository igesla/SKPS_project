# SKPS_project

This is an academic project based on Asmaa Hadane open tutorials https://github.com/AsmaaHADANE/Youtube-Tutorials/blob/master/flow_around_cylinder.zip The aim was to visualise different structures in the laminar flow around a cylinder varying on Reynolds number. From unseparated flow at Re=3, through Re=30 where pair of vortices are fixed in the wake, 180 - the case presented in the Asmaa Hadane tutorial --> a laminar vortex street to Re=1000.
